## Hello There, Im Krystian Kluczkiewicz here are the informations about my application! ðŸ‘‹

## About Aplication:
### I have created full and functional front-end application for cataloging books using the REST method.
### The project consists of two parts:
- Server - written in Java using Jersey (ready, downloadable from Github)
- Client - written in HTML and JavaScript, communicating with the server via AJAX.
### The server implements the Book class having its id, isbn, title, author, publisher, and genre.


## Project Goal?
- This page should show all books created on the system. The data should be loaded with AJAX from the address / books /.
- At the top of this page there will also be a form for creating new books that sends data via AJAX (POST method).
